Routes to the check-todos workflow which handles:
- Todo counting and listing with area filtering
- Interactive selection with full context loading
- Roadmap correlation checking
- Action routing (work now, add to phase, brainstorm, create phase)
- STATE.md updates and git commits
</objective>

<execution_context>
@.planning/STATE.md
@.planning/ROADMAP.md
@~/.claude/devflow/workflows/check-todos.md
</execution_context>
